I recently attended [EpicFEL](http://www.frontendlondon.co.uk/epic/) in Islington, London with [Joe Warren](https://twitter.com/joezo) and [Jack Crawford](https://twitter.com/jackdcrawford).

## Accessibility and how to get the most from your screenreader

### Edd Sowden { *[@edds](https://twitter.com/edds) - [website](http://e26.co.uk/) - [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/edds/accessibility-and-how-to-get-the-most-from-your-screenreader-epicfel)* }

Edd took us through a journey of how he and his team built the .gov websites with accessibility in mind. It's common to hear 'mobile first' development in this industry but unfortunately it's rare to hear 'accessibility first' development and his talk was really an eye opener to how neglected accessibility on the web is, not in terms of tools available but in terms of how developers rarely code with accessibility in mind.

He discusses how you can listen to your websites and see if what you are conveying to the user is what you intended, in most cases it isn't. There are several ways of dealing with this, Edd shows one of which is that you should place your main content at the top of your markup. He mentions that presentation is a CSS issue and not a markup issue.

> "By starting with HTML you are forced to think about what you want to say to your users."

He also mentioned that OSX and iOS are already bundled with a screenreader called VoiceOver. Give it a go by pressing: [cmd] + [F5], his slides contain some keyboard shortcuts and more can be found on [Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/osx/voiceover/).

[ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) (Accessibile Rich Internet Applications) is another great tool for developers to use for increasing the accessibility of their websites. It provides many HTML attributes to help deal with dynamic content and content delivered via AJAX requests etc. He also shows how ARIA should not be used for blocks of text.

His 5 accessibility learnings:

1. HTML5 enables you to group items using semantic tags, ARIA lets you name them
2. Reading entire pages from start to finish often isn't how people use screen readers
3. Some ARIA properties need to exist at page load to be picked up by Accessibility APIs
4. Avoid recreating native elements
5. Don't add too much extra 'semantic' markup

## The Case for HTTP/2

### Andy Davies { *[@andydavies](https://twitter.com/AndyDavies) - [website](http://andydavies.me/) -  [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/AndyDavies/the-case-for-http2-epicfel-sept-2015)* }

Andy began his talk by discussing the current limitations of HTTP/1.X and how we worked around them to increase the efficiency and speed of our websites. For example, HTTP works over TCP and TCP only supports one request at a time, therefore browsers allowed us to make parallel TCP connections to increase the number of resources we could fetch at one time. However then by splitting resources across domains in order to increase the number of parallel request we ran the risk of congesting the network. This is due to the overhead of setting up TCP requests, uncompressed headers are sent with every request and small requests don't fill the congestion window.

He then goes on to discuss HTTP/2 and the features that will be available, for example:

* Header compression
* Connection multiplexing
* Servers can push resources
* Each request is a stream

He shows that browser support is already looking pretty good and we're waiting for server implementations to catch up.

## The step after styleguides

### Ben Scott { *[@BPScott](https://twitter.com/BPScott) - [website](http://www.reload.me.uk/) - [slides](http://reload.me.uk/talk-the-step-after-styleguides)* }

Ben's discussion revolved around the use of styleguides, especially with [Amen](http://amen.tools.bbc.co.uk/) - the BBC pattern library. He explains the use for atoms, molecules and organisms in their library where you create small atomic components and combine them to make molecules and organisms. This is similar to the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) methodology in which we currently use in our [UI Toolkit](https://github.com/holidayextras/ui-toolkit).

## A hybrid app journey

## Death to icon fonts

### Seren Davies { *[@ninjanails](https://twitter.com/ninjanails) - [website](http://ninjanails.com/) - [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/ninjanails/death-to-icon-fonts)* }

A similar style to Edd's talk about screenreaders, Seren really captures the importance of accessibility when you don't know how people are viewing your sites. Her example involves a user using their own fonts on a webpage to make it easier for them to read, she uses [OpenDyslexic](http://opendyslexic.org/).

The reason for the title of this talk is that icon fonts don't play well with the fonts that the user wants to use and they replace icon fonts with a â–¡. This also affects screenreaders as they cannot see what the icon font was showing. There is also a difference in implementation when it comes to the 'private use area' of icon fonts, iOS has different icon fonts to Android etc. The alternative is to use SVG for the following reasons:

* Scalable
* Multi-coloured
* Can be animated
* Give context in their use

Quote of the conference:

> "Code like you give a damn."
