## Designing for people - Meagan Fisher [@owltastic](http://twitter.com/owltastic)
_Having exposure to real users is a must when building products, this talk went into the what, why & how of user testing_

* People building products need exposure to users to understand the feelings & needs of users
* Try and set a goal to meet, two hours every six weeks should be enough
* More user exposure = more innovation
* Common CEO explanation for startup failure: "People just don't get it, they don't see my vision"
* Make friends with reality
* Get proven wrong at lowest cost, identify problems for your users as early as possible
* Let go of our own assumptions
* Be easy to reach on social media, email, etc
* The technical team should be going through user support tickets
* Helpful user testing tools: [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com), [Full Story](http://fullstory.com) & [Inspectlet](http://inspectlet.com)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;Make friends with reality&quot;. What is it that your users actually want? Let go of your own assumptions.

## Don't give them what they want, give them what they need - Richard Rutter [@clagnut](http://twitter.com/clagnut)
_A case study on designing the [The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea](http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/) website_

* Identify what the client actually _needs_, not what they _want_. This is essential but is usually hard!
* Don't forget the call centre! They are a valuable user research resource that shouldn't be ignored
* All pages should have one primary goal split things that do two things into two pages
* Split up mental models e.g. don't ask for application number and street name in the same input field
* Always test your tests
* If all else fails, "blame it on the new CMS"

## Rethinking publishing - Peter Bil'ak [@peterbilak](http://twitter.com/peterbilak)
_An innovative solution to increasingly ineffective traditional publication methods, [social distribution](https://worksthatwork.com/distribution/)_

* Readers are a commodity sold to the advertisers
* Typography is the _only_ connection between different mediums (e.g. print & web)
* Flexible pricing model: how much is the user willing to pay?
* Online publishers should make unsubscribing easy
* Anything made by a human has been designed
* Removing something is also an act of design
* Build your maintenance into your product
* [Social distribution](https://worksthatwork.com/distribution/)

## Visualisation that takes us beyond the numbers - Natalie Yadrentseva [@natalieyadren](http://twitter.com/natalieyadren)
_An in-depth look into_

* Timelines - abstract from the personal feelings of time
* Use colour hue to show the differences in data
* Use colour intensity to represent magnitude
* [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>In data visualisation, color intensity drives to investigate.

## Building beyond the browser - Tom Gianattasio [@attasi](http://twitter.com/attasi)
_How the guys at [macaw](http://macaw.co/) used [node-webit](http://nwjs.io/) to build their desktop hybrid app_

* Gives you control over the window (draggable, shape, transparency)
* Chromium arguments can be passed in e.g. `--disable-web-security`
* Macaw uses React-like Virtual DOM diffs
* Macaw also uses Virtual CSS Object Model
  - CSSOM benchmarks: 15ms vs 220ms livereload
* Hybrid. Better. Faster. Stronger

## Is Blink the new IE6? - Bruce Lawson [@brucel](http://twitter.com/brucel)
_A plea to the community & browser developers to stop Blink becoming a monopoly, like IE6 was. A monopoly is bad for the web_

* We made them require IE6 - "Best viewed in IE6"
* iPhone almost influenced a Webkit monopoly
* Nobody reads specs, even fewer obey specs
* CSS prefixes e.g. `-webkit-cool-property` influence people to only support these _cool_ browsers
* No more prefixing in Blink, stop building a monopoly
* IE starting to alias `-webkit` prefixes
* Blink is being built by individuals, not companies
* Is native killing the web? We hope not
  - [Service workers](http://jakearchibald.com/2014/using-serviceworker-today/) can bridge the gap with offline
  - [Web manifest](http://html5doctor.com/web-manifest-specification/) (add to homescreen once user has engaged)
* We need to be the web, but better

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The lights went off during <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel">@brucel</a> talk.

## Welcome to Planet Fintlewoodlewix - Chris Heilmann [@codepo8](http://twitter.com/codepo8)
_Christian was the mystery speaker with an influential talk on more fixing and less innovating_

* Feeling like a fraud (overcompensate, aggression, lethargy)
* We don't control our users
* Forget about us, _they_ deserve to be connected
* Backwards compatibility shouldn't be a nuisance
* Excellence through repetition
* Learn the things, then use the frameworks
* Try to suck at things
* Minimum loveable product
* Fix the broken things before we build the new shiny broken things

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We should all build a &quot;Minimal Loveable Product&quot; not just a &quot;Minimal Viable Product&quot;. - <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8">@codepo8</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smashingconf?src=hash">#smashingconf</a></p>&mdash; Hungry Geek (@TheHungryGeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHungryGeek/status/578129931361771520">March 18, 2015</a></blockquote>

## Enhancing responsiveness with flexbox - Zoe Gillenwater [@zomigi](http://twitter.com/zomigi)

* Responsive web design is not binary, it's a continuum
* Look at workshop notes

## Debugging HTTP - Lorna Mitchell [@lornajane](http://twitter.com/lornajane)

* 6 stages of debugging (denial, frustration, disbelief, testing, gotcha, relief)
* Seeing the problem is harder than fixing it
* Devtools copy as cURL
* ngrok for local to public
* Charles proxy - debugging through proxies

## Making a silky smooth web - Paul Lewis [@aerotwist](http://twitter.com/aerotwist)

* Layout, painting, composite [csstriggers.com](http://csstriggers.com)
* Tools not rules
* `requestAnimationFrame` > `setTimeout`
* Use workers for lonnng JS
* Devtools timeline JS profiler
* CSS selectors
  - Did I limit the scope enough?
  - Are the selectors fast?
* Layout
  - Forced synchronous layout
  - Layout thrashing
  - FastDOM - batch up reads and writes
* Paint
  - Devtools timeline - paint profiler
* Reducing paint layer
  - `will-change`
  - `translateZ(0)` new layer
* Don't promote all the things, layers use memory
* Reduce paint complexity, look at the tools
* Composite
  - transform & opacity when on own layer
  - self-time, aim for ~5ms
* [RAIL](http://bit.ly/rail-perf)
  - Response (100ms after touch to respond)
  - Animation (10ms if we can)
  - Idle (moar work!?) 50ms at a time
  - Load (1000ms aim)

## User research for designers & engineers - Rachel Ilan Simpson [@rilan](http://twitter.com/rilan)

* Talking to users is _scary_, it could invalidate our products & ideas
* Why talk?
  - Identify new opportunities
  - Build the right thing
  - Fail early, fail often
* Don't deliver, practice
* Card sorting, cultural probes, codesign sessions
* [Pop app](https://popapp.in/), [Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/)
* Seth Godin
  - What is this?
  - Do I trust you?
  - What are you offering me?
  - How do I get it?
* The scrollwheel Guy Collins animation
* Debrief with team!

## UX of offline-first - Jake Archibald [@jaffathecake](http://twitter.com/jaffathecake)

* [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
* Let users play level one as soon as level one is ready
* Use markup for markup!
* Use _actual_ content
* Unblock your scripts
* Lie about performance
* Don't make fonts required on first render
* [React]([React]), [Ember fastboot](https://github.com/tildeio/ember-cli-fastboot)
* Critical CSS
* Distract the user with an actual experience
* Load scripts separately if functionality is different? HTTP2 benefits?
* Render time punished by assets loading quickly (`requestAnimationFrame`)
* The time people hate wasting the most is right now
* Lie-fi is like offline but it trolls you by pretending to be online
* Treat the network as an enhancement
* Service workers
  - Unobtrusive updates
  - "Update ready/available"
* Users don't trust offline web, _yet_
