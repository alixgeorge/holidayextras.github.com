We haven't yet had our [mobile moment](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1841]) at Holiday Extras but that hasn't stopped us as a tech team taking careful, considered approaches to everything we do on our websites, ensuring we always think mobile first.

So in January we decided to share our knowledge by running a session, we lovingly called **mobiletastic week**.

The aim was to get the rest of our in-house teams thinking about the power of mobile devices and what we can do as a company to use this power to benefit our customers.

We recorded a summary of the events we put on, let us know what you think.
