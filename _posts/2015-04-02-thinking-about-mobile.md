We haven't had our [mobile moment](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1841]) at Holiday Extras yet, but that hasn't stopped us as a tech team taking careful, considered approaches to everything we do on our websites, ensuring we always think mobile first.

So in January we decided to share our knowledge by running a session, we lovingly called **mobiletastic week**.

The aim was to get everybody thinking about the power of mobile devices and what we can do as a company to use this power to benefit our customers.

We recorded a summary of the events we put on. Let us know what you think.
