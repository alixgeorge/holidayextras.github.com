excerpt: "Exploratory software testing has matured and grown to encompass a wide range of activities. Meanwhile, computers can be automated to perform highly efficient and reliable checks without human intervention. How can we combine these two approaches to achieve the best results?"

I began my software testing career in 2006, which seems like a long time ago but in the grand scheme of things probably isn't. Even so, the world of testing has changed dramatically in that time.

For a start, exploratory testing—which used to be frowned upon as a technique—has matured and grown to encompass a whole range of activities. In fact, exploratory testing doesn't really exist as a technique in its own right any more; all testing techniques can be performed in an exploratory way to some degree. You might say that exploratory testing is just testing done properly.

A clearer distinction has also emerged between the rudimentary 'checking' that is often delegated to computers and the intelligent 'testing' that requires a curious human mind. I prefer to call the latter 'exploring'.

## The best of both worlds

It's true that checking is boring and so it often makes sense to have computers do it instead of people. The temptation is to automate everything and be done with it. If a little is good, more must be better, right? The thing is, checks on their own—whether performed by a computer or a person—can't reveal all of the bugs, let alone the risks and opportunities that exist in complex software.

### Computers are good at...
+ maths
+ simulation
+ generating data
+ validating against rules
+ doing repetitive tasks
+ multitasking
+ doing things quickly.

### People are better at...
+ recognising patterns
+ learning and reacting
+ ignoring false positives
+ being random
+ curiosity
+ creativity
+ empathy
+ understanding context
+ common sense.

The bottom line is that every project must include a healthy mix of checking and exploring in order to achieve the best possible coverage.

This is summed up particularly well by Elisabeth Hendrickson in her book <cite>Explore It!</cite> (2013):

> Tested = Checked + Explored
> You’re not done testing until you’ve checked that the software meets expectations and you’ve explored whether there are additional risks. A comprehensive test strategy incorporates both approaches.
