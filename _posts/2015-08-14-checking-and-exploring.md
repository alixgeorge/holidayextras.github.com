I began my software testing career in 2006, which seems like a long time ago but in the grand scheme of things probably isn't. Even so, the world of testing has changed dramatically in that time.

For a start, exploratory testing—which used to be frowned upon as a technique—has matured and grown to encompass a whole range of activities. In fact, exploratory testing doesn't really exist as a technique in its own right any more; all testing techniques can be performed in an exploratory way to some degree. Exploratory testing is just testing done properly.

A clearer distinction has also emerged between the rudimentary 'checking' that is often delegated to computers and the intelligent 'testing' that requires a curious human mind. I prefer to call the latter 'exploring'.

## The best of both worlds

The truth is that checking is boring and it makes sense to give as much of it as possible to computers instead of people.

### Computers are good at...
+ maths
+ simulation
+ generating data
+ validating against rules
+ doing repetitive tasks
+ multitasking
+ doing things quickly.

### People are better at...
+ recognising patterns
+ learning and reacting
+ ignoring false positives
+ being random
+ curiosity
+ creativity
+ empathy
+ understanding context
+ common sense.

The bottom line is that every project must include a healthy mix of checking and exploring.

This is summed up particularly well by Elisabeth Hendrickson in her book <cite>Explore It!</cite> (2013):

> Tested = Checked + Explored
> You’re not done testing until you’ve checked that the software meets expectations and you’ve explored whether there are additional risks. A comprehensive test strategy incorporates both approaches.
