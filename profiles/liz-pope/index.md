Liz started out as a QA Engineer at Holiday Extras in 2010, and quickly fell in love with testing. During her time at Holiday Extras she's revamped their testing department, worked as a scrum master, and is now successfully leading on People and Process within the 60-strong web team.

When not chatting about testing, agile or tech in general she enjoys playing and watching sport and looking at pictures of cute dogs.
