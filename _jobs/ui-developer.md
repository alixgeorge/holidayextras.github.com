We’re looking for innovative UI Developers to join us on the Holiday Extras campus and becoming part of our friendly, expert team. The workload is fast-paced, but the atmosphere is fun.

We want our UI Developers to bring creative solutions for front-end coding on a variety of  screen sizes and devices. The end result should be fast, simple and intuitive experiences for our users.

You will be part of our growing UX team and work collaboratively with the engineering teams. You will need to be pragmatic, proactive and understand the challenges and the opportunities that a large e-commerce business has to offer.  You will know when it's time to build the perfect solution and when to just get stuff done.

Your mission, working alongside our UX designers, will be to improve what we put in front of our customers, and solving their problems - as a result, you’ll thrive on feedback, critique and iteration.

You’ll have strong HTML, CSS/SASS/LESS and JavaScript skills, and enjoy refining the user experience through micro-interactions, UI design patterns and high performing front end code.

**We want to talk to you if you tick all of these boxes&hellip;**

Have at least two years of significant and proven experience of:

- HTML, CSS
- Javascript
- JSON, REST, AJAX, XML
- LESS/SASS
- Bootstrap
- Developing client side applications and comfortable within MVC and MVVM patterns
- Test driven development, including Unit, Functional and End-to-End tests
- Building Mobile First
- Working as part of an Agile development team

In addition, you must have strong communication skills and a flexible, pragmatic approach. Along with a passion for keeping up with ever changing technology to keep ahead of the game.

**It would be great if you’re also in the know about&hellip;**

- Multiple client side frameworks including React and Backbone, plus some server side javascript in Node.js
- Experience developing iOS and Android apps using Cordova or natively
- Current design trends in the digital space
- Creating concise and clear documentation, where appropriate
- Web analytics

We are looking for the best to join our team. We pride ourselves on being able to offer exciting challenges in the world of UX, whilst providing a fantastic environment in which to work. Along with pension, medical insurance, enhanced maternity, cycle-to-work schemes, etc we also have birthday days off, ‘Anytime +’ (our flexible working philosophy that says if you are contactable and connected it doesn’t matter where or when you work), and Project Lounge – our fortnightly ‘freedom to learn’ RnD sessions&hellip;

**If that sounds like you, we’d like to see&hellip;**

- A cover letter
- Your CV
- Examples code or designs on GitHub, Dribbble or equivalent.
