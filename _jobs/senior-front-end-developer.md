As an innovative and entrepreneurial travel-tech business, we are proud to run like a start-up (even after 10 years of success) and are rated the 5th best company in the UK to work for in the Sunday Times Top 100.

## The Web Team

We are a team of 19 that’s made up of Front End Developers, Back End Developers, QA’s, Project Managers as well as a Head of Technology, Head of Programme Delivery and a Technology Director.

We are an innovative team with lots of ideas and we are not afraid to try some of them out! Every other Friday is a full day of ‘Project Lounge’ where our Shortbreaks and Holiday Extras Web Teams get together to work on ideas within a ‘Freedom to Learn’ R&D session that they believe would be of benefit to their individual learning and/or benefit the group with fresh ideas.

## The Role

We are looking for an innovative Front End Developer to help shape our team’s development in the ever growing technology field. You will be a confident mentor to a small team of developers and must be proficient in test driven development, including Unit, Functional and End-to-End tests.

You will have significant, proven capability in development experience with an in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS Libraries.  You must also have experience in building Mobile First as our responsive projects are essential for the development of our websites.

We are keen to hear from people with a high level of experience in developing client side applications and you must be comfortable within MVC and MVVM patterns. You will also need to have excellent knowledge of CSS Preprocessors including PostCSS, LESS, SASS.JS, multiple client side frameworks including React, Angular and Backbone plus some server side javascript in Node.js. You would be expected to keep up with ever changing technology and where possible be ahead of the game.

Strong communication skills and a flexible approach is a must in our fast paced and agile environment. You will be pragmatic about when to spend time building the perfect solution and when to just get stuff done. Our ideal candidate would be somebody who could really move our business forward.
